export { default as NotAuthorized } from './NotAuthorized';

// If you add more globally reusable common components to this directory in the future
// (e.g., a generic Button, Modal, Spinner, etc.),
// you would add their exports here as well. For example:
// export { default as AppButton } from './AppButton';
// export { default as AppModal } from './AppModal';
