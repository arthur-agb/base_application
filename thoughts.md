We should add an additional step here which changes the tick box function to a letter/symbol denotion.  Where a tick means it is included as a dimension, a capital sigma sign means it is being summed, or a final symbol to indicate there is a custom function being created - in this final case we are potentially creating a new column so we should use the alias provided in SQL.
